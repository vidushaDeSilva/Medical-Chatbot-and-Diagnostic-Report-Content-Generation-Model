Medical Diagnosis Assistant Web Application

This project consists of two distinct models designed to assist in medical diagnosis via a web application:

	1.	Medical Chatbot Model: Trained to interact with users by answering medical questions related to various lung and heart conditions.
	2.	Diagnostic Report Content Generation Model: Trained to generate detailed diagnostic reports based on probable medical conditions, helping users understand their health status.

Models

1. Medical Chatbot Model

	•	Purpose: To answer user inquiries about medical conditions.
	•	Dataset: Custom-built dataset focusing on medical conditions affecting the lungs and heart.
	•	Training Platform: Google AI Studio (Gemini 1.0 Pro 001).

2. Diagnostic Report Content Generation Model

	•	Purpose: To generate medical reports that summarize and explain possible health conditions based on user inputs.
	•	Dataset: Designed from scratch, focusing on generating human-readable reports for 14 medical conditions.
	•	Training Platform: Google AI Studio (Gemini 1.0 Pro 001).
