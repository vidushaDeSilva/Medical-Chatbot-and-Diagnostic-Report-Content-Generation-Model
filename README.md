# Medical Chatbot and Diagnostic Report Content Generation Model
Created two medical chatbots for a medical diagnosis assistant web application.
One model was trained to be a medical chatbot to answer questions from the user.
Other dataset was trained to genreate content diagnostic report to inform the user about the probable condtions.
Used Google AI Studio to fine tune Gemini 1.0 Pro 001.

Datasets about the following 14 condtions.
1. Atelectasis
2. Cardiomegaly
3. Effusion
4. Infiltration
5. Lung Mass
6. Lung Nodule
7. Pneumonia
8. Pneumothorax
9. Consolidation
10. Edema
11. Emphysema
12. Fibrosis
13. Pleural Thickening
14. Hernia
was created from scratch.
